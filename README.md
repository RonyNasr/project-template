#### By Kevin VanEvery, Cory Olson, and Patrick Lipscomb

## Description

This repository contains the following folders and files.  They can be used to support a basic project template for the beginning of each of your projects.

### css

This folder contains the css files that support the Bootstrap framework in parallel with files in the /js folder.  There is also a styles.css file which contains custom user scripts.

### js

This folder contains the js files that support the Bootstrap framework in parallel with files in the /css folder.  It also contains the js files to support JQuery.  There is also a scripts.js file which contains custom user scripts.

### fonts

This folder contains the files which support glyphicons in Bootstrap.

### img

This folder contains useful placeholder images.  There are four sizes

* thumbnail
* small
* medium
* large

and three orientations

* square
* portrait
* landscape

for a total of 15 images.  There is also a user profile square image, since that is common, and a favicon.

### index.html

This file contains basic markup for a starter page.  Markup includes a header and footer within a body tag and a div container with text.  The important feature is the head tag which includes the five Bootstrap, JQuery, and custom css and js files.  

### css/styles.css

This is your custom css file.

### js/scripts.js

This is your custom js file.

### .pairs

This is a .pairs file.  You can fill it in with your info, then save it to your github.  Then at least half the file will be written every day.  There are 108 pair classes in a full Epicodus curriculum so this will save you almost an hour of your life.   

### README.md

## Setup/Installation Requirements

To install this repository locally, first

* Clone the github repository using the git clone command from /Desktop
* Move the .pairs folder to the /users folder (one level up from /Desktop)
* Create a new folder in the Desktop with your project name
* Copy and paste the entire contents of the cloned /bootstrap-jquery-project-template into your new folder (this should not include the .pairs file)
* Move into your new folder and initialize git as normal
* Congrats! You now have a new repo based on this template.

Some **DONT'S**

* Don't just rename the cloned git repository - that will mess up future commits.  Do the copy/paste
* If you're using a bootstrap template, don't replace the <head> tag.  Only change the <body> tag.  The templates include code at the top and bottom that bring in js and css we're already including and a bunch we don't use.  If you call a js or css file twice, it causes problems.  

## Known Bugs

None.  But I haven't really tested much, so if you find anything, let me know and we'll fix it and update the repo.  

## Support and contact details
